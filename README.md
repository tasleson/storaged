Storaged, a D-Bus service for storage management
================================================

Currently, storaged implements a D-Bus API for monitoring and
manipulating LVM2 volume groups, but there is room for more.

Storaged works well with UDisks, and tries not to duplicate its
functionality.  For example, you would create a new logical volume
with storaged and then make a filesystem on it with UDisks.

CAVEAT:

    This is pre-release software.  Only install it in a system that
    you are ready to lose.  It is a good idea to make a virtual
    machine to play around with storaged.
