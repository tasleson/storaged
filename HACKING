CODING STYLE
============

 - Please follow the coding style already used (which is close to the
   GNU style) - if adding new files please include the following mode
   line for emacs and other editors:

   -*- mode: C; c-file-style: "gnu"; indent-tabs-mode: nil; -*-

 - Spaces, not tabs, are used.

 - All external interfaces (network protocols, file formats, etc.)
   should be documented in man pages or other documentation.


COMMITTING CODE
===============

 - Commit messages should be of the form (the five lines between the
   lines starting with ===)

=== begin example commit ===
Short explanation of the commit

Longer explanation explaining exactly what's changed, whether any
external or private interfaces changed, what bugs were fixed (with bug
tracker reference if applicable) and so forth. Be concise but not too brief.
=== end example commit ===

 - Always add a brief description of the commit to the _first_ line of
   the commit and terminate by two newlines (it will work without the
   second newline, but that is not nice for the interfaces).

 - First line (the brief description) must only be one sentence and
   must start with a capital letter. Don't use a trailing period.

 - The main description (the body) is normal prose and should use normal
   punctuation and capital letters where appropriate. Normally, for patches
   sent to a mailing list it's copied from there.

 - When committing code on behalf of others use the --author option, e.g.
   git commit -a --author "Joe Coder <joe@coder.org>"

 - If submitting (or commiting) patch in Bugzilla prefix the first
   line with "Bug <Number> — <Bug Title>" (the dash is U+2014 EM DASH,
   not '-') and include the bug URL in the commit message. Example:
   "Bug 24885 — LVM LVs now have NOPOLICY=0" and
   http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24885.

RUNNING TESTS
=============

Since LVM tests can be destructive, we make sure to run the tests on another
machine, such as a virtual machine. This machine is called the target.

Prerequisites:

 * The target machine must have the same operating system and version as
   the machine that is building storaged.
 * The target machine must be accessible as root via SSH from the
   build machine, preferrably with an SSH key.
 * The build directory of storaged must be NFS mounted in exactly the
   same location on the target machine. This mount can be read-only,
   unless coverage testing is desired.
 * All dependencies of storaged must be installed on the target machine.

Export build directory on build machine:

 * Put this in /etc/exports on build machine

   /path/to/build  IP.OF.TAR.GET/255.255.255.255 (ro,all_squash,anonuid=XXX,anongid=XXX)

 * Run this:

   # systemctl restart nfs-server

Mount build directory on target machine:

 * Run this:

   # mkdir -p /path/to/build
   # mount IP.OF.BUI.LD:/path/to/build /path/to/build

Running the tests

 * Specify the target machine in an environment variable when running tests:

   # TEST_TARGET=root@IP.OF.TAR.GET make check
